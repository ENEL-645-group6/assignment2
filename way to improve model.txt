1. Training Duration & Data:
Increase number of epochs (currently only 3)
Use larger batch size
Implement learning rate scheduling
Add more data augmentation for images
2. Model Architecture:
Unfreeze some layers of DistilBERT
Try different image backbone models (ResNet, EfficientNet)
Adjust fusion layer architecture
Modify dropout rates
Add batch normalization layers
3.Text Processing:
Increase max_len for text tokens (currently 24)
Try different text preprocessing techniques
Use full BERT instead of DistilBERT
Fine-tune text model parameters
4.Optimization:
Try different learning rates
Experiment with different optimizers (AdamW, SGD with momentum)
Implement gradient clipping
Use weight decay for regularization
5.Class Imbalance:
Use class weights in loss function
Implement oversampling/undersampling
Try focal loss instead of cross-entropy
6.Ensemble Methods:
Train multiple models with different seeds
Create separate models for image and text, then ensemble
Use cross-validation
